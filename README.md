# QOSF Mentorship 2020

Hi! I'm Aditya Giridharan and this is my submission for the [QOSF Mentorship Programme 2020](https://qosf.org/qc_mentorship/).  

I will be tackling **Problem 2**, so that's the one to judge the application by. My solution can be found in the notebook titled **Task 2.ipynb**.
    
Any _other_ solutions here were not necessarily worked on before the deadline...

If the notebook (or any of the MathJax in it) is not rendered correctly on GitHub, please [view it on nbviewer instead.](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/aditya-giri/qosf-mentorship-tasks/blob/master/Task%202.ipynb)
    
  
If you wish to run the notebook locally, please run `pip install -r requirements.txt`, preferably in a virtual environment (using conda or venv) and register the virtual environment with the IPython kernel. Or, open the notebook and run `!pip install -r requirements.txt` on a fresh cell before proceeding. If you wish to use Colab instead, [use this link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/aditya-giri/qosf-mentorship-tasks/blob/master/Task%202.ipynb). If you are using Colab, you will probably need to upload `requirements.txt` and run `!pip install -r requirements.txt` before proceeding.
  
My approach to the problem and all necessary calculations and steps have been highlighted in the notebook.

Thank you!
