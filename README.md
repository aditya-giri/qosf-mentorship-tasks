# QOSF Mentorship 2020

Hi! I'm Aditya Giridharan and this is my submission for the [QOSF Mentorship Programme 2020](https://qosf.org/qc_mentorship/).  

I will be tackling **Problem 2**, so that's the one to judge the application by.
    
Any _other_ solutions here were not necessarily worked on before the deadline...

Since the solution is written on a Jupyter Notebook and contains a lot of mathematical equations, it is recommended to [view it on nbviewer.](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/aditya-giri/qosf-mentorship-tasks/blob/master/Task%202.ipynb)
  
  
Thank you!
